# RP2040 Control Software

Software to control GMM-7550 module on USB and USB&nbsp;3 adapter boards.

Current version is developed on a prototype platform base on
a Raspberry Pi Pico board and HAT adapter.

## 2025-12-01 -- basic functionality is implemented

- module power control
- hard and soft reset control
- FPGA configuration mode and SPI multiplexer control
- UART interface to the GMM-7550 module
- SPI inteface for FPGA configuration

Video of the GMM-7550 module controlled by RP2050 (Pico-based prototype)
shows three demo FPGA projects:

- UART loopback (with LED activity indicator) loaded from on-board SPI NOR FLASH
- simple blinking LED demo
- more elaborate 8 LEDs light-show

LED demos are loaded from a host PC via USB/SPI inteface.
